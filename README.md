# Phase's Simple Discord Rich Presence

A simple mod that displays Discord Rich Presence for Hytale when playing in a Singleplayer World! Planning to add more features (if possible) in the future, so this is more of a proof of concept than anything else.

> This mod will only work when playing in Singleplayer. I have not (and can not as of now) test multiplayer but considering the way Hytale is set up, I don't believe the mod will work on a server. Very sorry :(
